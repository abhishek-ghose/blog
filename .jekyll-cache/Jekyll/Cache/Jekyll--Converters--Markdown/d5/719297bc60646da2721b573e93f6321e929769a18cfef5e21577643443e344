<p>Moving to a new place can be hectic and tiresome. I am moving my blog, from <a href="http://quipu-strands.blogspot.com/">here</a>, and it‚Äôs none of those.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Yeesh, a feeble attempt at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraprosdokian">Paraprosdokian</a>. Anyhoo.</p>

<p>I tend towards writing technical posts when I tend towards writing at all these days, and <a href="https://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> doesn‚Äôt give me the presentation options I need. So, for now, its GitHub pages<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, but with my own domain. That way, if I decide to move again, my (almost non-existent) readers won‚Äôt be sent scrambling to find my (almost non-existent) content.</p>

<p>The old blog was titled ‚ÄúRandom Thoughts‚Äù. I wanted something different and bit more original this time, so I Googled ‚ÄúNot So Random Thoughts‚Äù. Obviously.</p>

<p>So many hits it isn‚Äôt even funny. So many, that you couldn‚Äôt squint and ignore. And that is exactly why you are stuck with ‚ÄúA Not So Primordial Soup‚Äù; which, by the way, does a good job of telling you that this is going to be a mixed bag of the deep and the frivolous.</p>

<p>Just for the record, ‚ÄúThe Psionic Poodle‚Äù was on the list. Since that isn‚Äôt the title, joy to us, things might have been worse.</p>

<p>Now for some quick tests to see if this platform holds up. Grouping them here, so that if I switch to a new platform/theme etc, I can use this post as a quick check to see if the various non-text entities I use are displayed correctly. My regression tests, if you will.</p>

<p>During my research to move, I discovered, quite to my surprise, that having a reliable comment system is something of a challenge. <em>In 2017</em>. I mean in a few years I could be sitting in my self-driving car (Update in 2022: yeah, this dated well.) and worrying about comment systems.</p>

<p>More updates from 2022: When I had initially moved to GitHub pages, commenting systems left much to be desired. I did have <a href="https://www.talkyard.io/">Talkyard</a> on here for a while, which is a nifty system. But now we have options like <a href="https://utteranc.es/">utterances</a> and <a href="https://giscus.app/">giscus</a>, which feel like a more natural fit for something that‚Äôs hosted on GitHub. I am going to integrate one of them soon.</p>

<p>See you later then?
