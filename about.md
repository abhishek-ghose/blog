Hi! 

I am Abhishek Ghose. My interests are machine learning, math, puzzles and programming. I love to read in my spare time. While my reading is not limited to those topics, posts here probably will be :)

I have a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering, a Masters in Computer Science and Engineering, and I am currently working on a PhD in Machine Learning. The PhD is part-time and I work a day job as a Data Scientist.

About this blog:
