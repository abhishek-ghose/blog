Hi! 

I am Abhishek Ghose. My interests are machine learning, math, puzzles and programming. I love to read in my spare time. While my reading is not limited to those topics, posts here probably will be :)

I have a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering, a Masters in Computer Science and Engineering, and I am currently working on a PhD in Machine Learning. The PhD is part-time and I work a day job as a Data Scientist.

About this blog:
* Uses Jekyll and is currently hosted on GitHub pages
* My domain registrar is Namecheap
* Theme: Minima with minor changes
* Markdown flavor: Kramdown
* The font used is Helvetica (the default for Minima)
* I'm also using [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for some of the icons
* For comments, I am trying out [Talkyard](https://www.talkyard.io/blog-comments)
