Hi!

I am Abhishek Ghose. My interests are machine learning, math, puzzles and programming. I love to read in my spare time. While my reading is not limited to those topics, posts here probably will be :)

I have a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering, a Masters and a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering (specifically Machine Learning). My Ph.D. research looked at reducing model sizes while minimally sacrificing their accuracy. I work a day job as a Data Scientist.

About this blog:
* Uses Jekyll and is currently hosted on GitHub pages. Citations use [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar).
* My domain registrar is Namecheap.
* Theme: Minima with minor changes.
* Markdown flavor: Kramdown.
* I'm also using [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for some of the icons.
