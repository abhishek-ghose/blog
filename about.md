Hi!

I am Abhishek Ghose. My interests are machine learning, math, puzzles and programming. I love to read in my spare time. While my reading is not limited to those topics, posts here probably will be :)

I have a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering, a Masters and a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering (specifically Machine Learning). My Ph.D. research looked at reducing model sizes while minimally sacrificing their accuracy. I work a day job as a Data Scientist.
